# List of available models in Greek --

The project of recording the available sources in Greek is part of the efforts that EELLAK immediately started with the publication of ChatGPT and the global rise of interest in advanced speech-generating neural networks.

Bypassing various popular and misleading focuses on the topic of artificial intelligence, as an Open Technology Organization, we see artificial intelligence as a new technology for organizing and accessing human knowledge, which has great practical value, that is why we must highlight the importance of open standards from the very first stages,of open and ethically secured data, privacy protection, digital divide provision, data security.

An important part of our approach has focused on the adoption of advanced language technologies in the context of e-government. It is immediately possible, and possible to an extent, public services to utilize these technologies either to serve the citizen through digital assistants or to carry out internal processes that would otherwise require a lot of human effort.

This is why the popular discussions about an existential threat to humanity and superhumanism are disorienting. There are immediate issues of a much more practical nature, with direct social impact, which are better discussed at this time. 
Just as great will be the impact on labor relations (see our article on the strike of screenwriters in Hollywood, and their claims for the delimitation of TN in the scope of their work).

Let us dwell on these issues for a moment: Speech-generating technology in the public sector, in the service of the citizen, in the internal processes of e-government. Introduction of speech production technology in labor relations. It immediately becomes clear that **the absence of a competent model in the Greek language** it is a visible risk of widening the digital divide both in the citizen-state relationship and in the effort to find a job.

As innovative as it is, the technology of speech-generating neural networks, it does not cease to be an extension of our previous technological and especially computer speech processing techniques, machine learning, big data.From these technologies they inherit not only advantages but also risks,especially in a legal environment of technology oligopoly protectionism, which has concerned the open technology community for several years.

Unfortunately, the readiness of the Greek language to enter dynamically into these new technologies is weakened by political and strategic choices that extend several decades into the past.Closed-source Greek LLM's are already being formed by those structures that have high-quality data for their training. But our community remains poor in data, that's why we insist that creating open, ethically sourced, mechanically accessible,and representative of the Greek language body of training examples, remains and will remain an end in itself for the open software community.

So our efforts were led to exactly this: the de-editing and recording of the available sources in Greek with permission to reuse. But there is a paradox in this: Any data that is easily accessible, is already in a machine-readable form, or is labeled in some way, will surely have already found its way into existing language models.

Most data of high linguistic value on the historicity and diversity of the Greek language, which also reflect the various textual genres and varieties of its use, they are to some extent digitized, but in the majority of cases not mechanically accessible, or due to user-unfriendly structure of the website navigation, either because there is no OCR, or because there are no reuse licenses.

So where are we headed?The facts of the problem are clear. Easily accessible data has already been exploited. Hard-to-access data involves an unfathomable amount of human effort. Closed data is and will remain closed. It is almost certain that we will soon see a closed language model in the Greek language. But that will do nothing to change the dystopian realization that open technologies will take an unprecedented hit. The mainstream technology of the coming era will have started with a decisive advantage of closed technologies and closed data. Beyond our activist concerns, however, the adverse effects have also been highlighted by international organizations, as well as by the European Commission.

The idea that the data of an entire nation's citizens can be uploaded to the remote computers of a transatlantic technology oligopoly, with all the security and privacy risks, it's just plain dangerous, and contrary to a series of European directives to which Greece has committed itself. The facile solution of sourcing word processing technology from foreign tech hawkers is a minefield for security, privacy, innovation, and its implications will soon be seen.
