### Goal of EELLAK
The goal of EELLAK is the development of a Greek Open Source language model, named glossAPI (a Greek Open Source LLM), whose code will be available under the EUPL open source license, and its data will be distributed under the Creative Commons BY-SA license.

### üîÑ New Features:
- Try the **text tokenizer** (example usage) and ‚úèÔ∏è provide feedback through the Issues!
- Explore an application inspired by **digital humanities**.
- **Subscribe** to the newsletter at [https://newsletters.ellak.gr](https://newsletters.ellak.gr/) to stay updated on glossAPI.

### üéôÔ∏è Stay Connected:
- **Matrix**: Introduce yourself with a short message.
- **Catalog of Available Models in Greek**: EELLAK has initiated efforts to document available Greek language resources following the release of ChatGPT and the global surge in interest in advanced generative neural networks.

### Why Focus on Open Standards?
As an Open Technology Organization, EELLAK views AI not as an existential threat to humanity but as a new technology for organizing and accessing human knowledge with significant practical value. From the early stages, we emphasize the importance of:
- Open standards
- Ethically sourced open data
- Privacy protection
- Bridging digital divides
- Ensuring data security

### Applications in Public Administration:
Advanced linguistic technologies could revolutionize electronic governance by enabling public services to:
- Assist citizens through digital assistants
- Streamline internal processes otherwise requiring significant human effort

---

### Challenges:
The lack of a capable Greek language model poses a tangible risk of widening the digital gap, both in citizen-state interactions and in job-seeking efforts. While innovative, generative neural networks inherit not only the advantages but also the challenges of earlier technologies, particularly within a regulatory environment protective of technological monopolies.

The readiness of the Greek language to engage with these new technologies has been weakened by decades of political and strategic decisions. Some organizations with access to high-quality data are developing proprietary Greek LLMs. However, the community remains impoverished in terms of data resources. Therefore, creating an open, ethically sourced, machine-accessible, and representative dataset for the Greek language remains a top priority for the open-source community.

---

### Efforts and Observations:
- EELLAK‚Äôs focus has been on cataloging and documenting reusable Greek-language sources.
- Paradoxically, the most linguistically valuable data‚Äîreflecting diverse textual genres and uses of the Greek language‚Äîare often digitized but not machine-accessible due to user-hostile website structures, lack of OCR, or restrictive licenses.
- While easily accessible data have already been utilized, inaccessible data require extensive effort. Closed datasets will remain closed.
- It‚Äôs almost certain that a proprietary Greek language model will emerge soon, but this will mark a significant disadvantage for open technologies.

### The Importance of Open Data:
The idea that the data of an entire nation could be transferred to remote servers of a transatlantic tech monopoly poses security and privacy risks and contradicts numerous European directives binding Greece. Relying on external technology providers is a minefield for:
- Security
- Privacy
- Innovation
